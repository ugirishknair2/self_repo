The term is sometimes used quite loosely, to mean files that contain only "readable" content
(or just files with nothing that the speaker does not prefer). 
For example, that could exclude any indication of fonts or layout (such as markup, markdown, or even tabs); 
characters such as curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, soft hyphens, em dashes, and/or ligatures; or other things.
